- You can subtract numbers from each other using the `-` operator.

## 3. Calculate the preparation time in minutes

- You can multiply numbers using the `*` operator.

## 4. Calculate the total working time in minutes

- You can call other defined functions you might find useful, e.g., `function($arg)`.
