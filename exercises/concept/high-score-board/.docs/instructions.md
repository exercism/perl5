# Instructions

You're going to write some code to manage a scoreboard for a game.
The scoreboard will be a hash called `%HighScoreBoard::Scores`.
The keys of the hash will be the names of the players, and the values will be their scores.

## 1. Set a player's score in the %Scores hash

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::set_player_scores` subroutine, which takes player names and scores as arguments, to set the players' scores in the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash.

## 2. Get a player's score from the %Scores hash 

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::get_player_score` subroutine, which takes a player name as an argument, to return the player's score from the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash.

## 3. Increase a player's score in the %Scores hash

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::increase_player_scores` subroutine, which takes players names and scores as arguments, to increase the players' scores in the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash by the given score.

## 4. Sort the players in the %Scores hash by their name

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::sort_players_by_name` subroutine to return the players names in the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash sorted by their name.

## 5. Sort the players in the %Scores hash by their score

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::sort_players_by_score` subroutine to return the players names in the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash sorted by their score.

## 6. Delete a player from the %Scores hash

Modify the `HighScoreBoard::delete_player` subroutine, which takes a player name as an argument, to delete the player from the `%HighScoreBoard::Scores` hash.
