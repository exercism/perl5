# Instructions

You're going to write some code to manage a list of programming languages to learn.
The list will be contained in an array called `@LanguageList::Languages`.

## 1. Add a language to the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::add_language` subroutine, which takes a language name as an argument, to add the language to the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.

## 2. Remove a language from the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::remove_language` subroutine to remove the last language from the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.

## 3. Fetch the first language from the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::first_language` subroutine to return the first language in the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.

## 4. Fetch the last language from the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::last_language` subroutine to return the last language in the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.

## 5. Fetch a slice of languages from the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::get_languages` subroutine, which takes a list of numbers for wanted elements, to return a slice of the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.

## 6. Check if a language exists in the @Languages array

Modify the `LanguageList::has_language` subroutine, which takes a language name as an argument, to return either a true or false value indicating if the language exists in the `@LanguageList::Languages` array.
