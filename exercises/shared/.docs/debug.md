# Debug

When a test fails, a message is displayed describing what went wrong.
If you would like additional output, you can use the subroutine `::YYY()` around the code you would like to inspect.
(`::` is a shortcut for `main::`).
This subroutine is part of the [XXX][XXX] module.

You may also simply print a message using the `say` function, e.g., `say 'Hello, World!';`.
