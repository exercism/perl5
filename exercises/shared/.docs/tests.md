# Tests

There is a Perl 5 script with the extension `.t`, which will be used to test
your solution. You can run through the tests by using the command:

```bash
`prove .`
```

Documentation about the assertions used in the test files can be found in
[Test2::Manual::Testing::Introduction](https://metacpan.org/pod/Test2::Manual::Testing::Introduction).
