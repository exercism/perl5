# Tests

There is a Perl script with the extension `.t` contained in the `t/` directory, which will be used to test your solution.
You can run through the tests by using the command:

```bash
`prove`
```

Documentation about the assertions used in the test files can be found in [Test2::Manual::Testing::Introduction][test2-manual].
