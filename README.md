Exercism exercises in Perl 5

## Dependencies

The tests depend on the `JSON` and `DateTime` modules.

## Testing the Tests

When the tests are run they expect a module with some real name (e.g. Anagram.pm)
but the Exercism system allows us to have example implementations in the directory
of each exercise.

If they are called /*example.*/i they won't be copied to the users. (which is a good thing).

So the sample solutions are all called Example.pm.

### Testing All the Exercises

Run the full tests with

    EXERCSIM=1 prove -r

### Testing a Single Exercise

Each test file will look for the appropriate module name, but if the test are run as

    EXERCISM=1 perl file.t

then they will expect a file called Example.pm
