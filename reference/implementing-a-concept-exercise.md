# How to implement a Perl concept exercise

* Create a concept in the config.json concepts array e.g. Arrays, Hashes.
* Create an exercise associated with that concept. See [stories][stories] for ideas.
* Create a test file in the `t` directory, a stub in the `lib` directory, and an example solution in the `.meta` directory.
