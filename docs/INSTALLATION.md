### Windows:
[Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/): A 100% Open Source Perl for
Windows that is exactly the same as Perl everywhere else; this includes using
modules from CPAN, without the need for binary packages.

### Unix/Linux/Mac OSX:
Perl is likely already installed. Run `perl -v` to check which version you have.
If your version is older than v5.14.0, or you would like to try out newer versions
of Perl 5, take a look at 'Other Options'.

If you are using Fedora/Red Hat/CentOS, some core modules are not included with Perl.
Use the `yum install perl-core` command to install them.

### Other Options:
* [perlbrew](https://perlbrew.pl/): A tool to manage multiple perl installations
  in your `$HOME` directory. They are completely isolated perl universes.
* [plenv](https://github.com/tokuhirom/plenv): Installs perls under your home
  directory and lets you install modules locally, and allows you to switch to
  arbitrary perl versions on your shell.
* [ActivePerl Community Edition](https://www.activestate.com/activeperl/downloads):
  A free, ready-to-install Perl distribution for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X, designed 
  for community developers or open source projects that are not business- or mission-critical.
